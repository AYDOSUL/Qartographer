# Qartographer

Qartographer is an open-source computational tool for designing and optimizing wire layouts in quantum processors. It helps researchers and engineers create compact, efficient, and high-fidelity quantum chips by automating a critical part of the physical design process.

## Key Features

1. **Automated Wire Routing**  
   Uses an optimization framework to find the best paths for control and readout lines, minimizing crosstalk and noise.

2. **Multi-objective Optimization**  
   Balances key design constraints such as line length, proximity to qubits, and overall layout density.

3. **Modular Workflow**  
   The tool suite includes components to merge, split, and visualize design data, providing a flexible and repeatable process.

## How It Works

Qartographer leverages SciPy's optimization module to minimize a carefully crafted cost function. This function penalizes undesirable characteristics like wires that are too close to each other or excessively long. By automating this complex task, Qartographer allows for rapid exploration of different design configurations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AYDOSUL/Qartographer.git
   cd Qartographer
2. Follow the instructions in the `docs` directory to install dependencies and run the tool.
3. Qartographer uses a simple JSON format for input and output, making it easy to integrate into existing design workflows.
